# Migrating from TypeORM to Prisma

This document outlines the strategy and steps for migrating from TypeORM to Prisma in our NestJS application.

## Migration Strategy

We're using a phased approach to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting the application's functionality:

1. **Parallel Operation Phase**: Both TypeORM and Prisma run side by side
2. **Gradual Transition Phase**: Services are updated to use Prisma instead of TypeORM
3. **Cleanup Phase**: TypeORM is removed once all services are migrated

## Current Implementation

The current implementation includes:

- Prisma schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- PrismaService for managing the Prisma client
- PrismaUserRepository for handling user-related database operations
- Updated UserService that can work with both TypeORM and Prisma

## How It Works

The system uses a feature flag approach to control which ORM is active:

```
# In .env file
USE_PRISMA=false  # Set to true to use Prisma
```

When `USE_PRISMA` is set to `false`, the application continues to use TypeORM exclusively. When set to `true`, the application uses Prisma for database operations, while still maintaining TypeORM for backward compatibility.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Setup Phase (Completed)

- ✅ Install Prisma dependencies
- ✅ Initialize Prisma and create schema
- ✅ Create PrismaService
- ✅ Create PrismaModule
- ✅ Add PrismaModule to AppModule

### 2. User Module Migration (Completed)

- ✅ Create PrismaUserRepository
- ✅ Update UserService to support both ORMs
- ✅ Add feature flag for controlling which ORM to use

### 3. Testing Phase

- Run the application with TypeORM (default)
- Test all user-related functionality
- Set `USE_PRISMA=true` in .env
- Test all user-related functionality again
- Compare performance and behavior

### 4. Auth Module Migration (Completed)

- ✅ Create PrismaAuthRepository
- ✅ Update AuthService to work with both ORMs
- ✅ Update JwtStrategy to work with both ORMs
- ✅ Add logging and error handling

### 5. Complete Migration (Completed)

- ✅ Remove TypeORM dependencies from package.json
- ✅ Remove TypeORM configuration
- ✅ Remove TypeORM entities and repositories references
- ✅ Update services to use only Prisma
- ✅ Remove feature flags and dual-write mechanisms

## Benefits of Prisma

- Type-safe database queries with auto-generated types
- Simpler and more intuitive API
- Better performance for complex queries
- Automatic migrations
- Improved developer experience

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered during the migration:

1. Set `USE_PRISMA=false` in .env
2. The application will revert to using TypeORM exclusively
3. Fix any issues in the Prisma implementation
4. Try again with `USE_PRISMA=true`

## Commands

### Migration Scripts

We've created scripts to help with the migration process:

#### Initial Migration Script

```bash
./scripts/migrate-to-prisma.sh
```

This script:
- Pulls the database schema from the existing database
- Generates the Prisma client
- Validates the schema
- Provides next steps

#### Finalization Script

```bash
./scripts/finalize-prisma-migration.sh
```

This script:
- Removes TypeORM dependencies
- Removes TypeORM configuration
- Updates app.module.ts to remove TypeORM
- Cleans up user module
- Updates .env to remove USE_PRISMA flag

**Important**: Only run this script after thoroughly testing the application with Prisma enabled.

### Manual Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma generate

# Pull database schema from existing database
npx prisma db pull

# Create migration from schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Apply migrations to database
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npx prisma studio
```
